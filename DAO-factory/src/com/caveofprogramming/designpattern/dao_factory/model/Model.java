/**
 * The Model class deals with the data on the back end.<br>
 * As with the {@code  View} class case, the names of the class and the root
 * package are used for illustrative purposes in this tutorial.
 * <p>
 * It is important to remember that the {@code model} should never import or
 * use anything from the {@code view} or {@code controller} packages. The
 * {@code model} should be a self-contained component, capable of being
 * tested independently.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This representation of a classic model class, though currently empty,
 * will be implemented in future steps. It is worth noting that some programs
 * may not implement a dedicated Model class at all, while others may use a
 * single Model class for an specific task or even multiple Models classes.
 * The structure of the MVC pattern varies based on the program's requirements.
 * A good approach is to think of the Model as a package or concept rather than
 * a specific class.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * It's not always the case that the controller interacts with a single model class.
 * In this application, for example, the Controller works with multiple classes from
 * the Model package.
